# Flasknado! #

A trivial demonstration of using [Tornado][] and [Flask][] together.

[Tornado]: http://www.tornadoweb.org
[Flask]: http://flask.pocoo.org/

## Why? ##

Tornado is a very powerful and flexible asynchronous HTTP server with
support for things like websockets. Meanwhile, Flask is a fantastic
web microframework that makes writing web applications fun and
easy. Flasknado! then demonstrates how to use Tornado to run a Flask
WSGI app to exploit the strengths of both.
